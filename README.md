# Notion Notes
Notion Notes is an app reskin of [Notion's iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notion-notes-tasks-ai/id1232780281) based on [iOSâ€™ native notes app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/notes/id1110145109), with all the notes taken being added to a connected [Notion account](https://www.notion.com/).
## Why?
Even though iOS' notes app can also be used on a [browser](https://www.icloud.com/notes/), I want to have the notes connected directly to Notion. I'm also very used to Apple's Notes app, so I want to have it look the same.
